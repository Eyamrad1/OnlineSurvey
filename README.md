# QuickSurvey: Online Survey Management Platform

**Technologies Used**: Angular, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT

## Project Description:

QuickSurvey is a complete online survey management platform, developed with Angular (frontend) and Spring Boot (backend). This application allows administrators to create, manage, and analyze surveys in real-time while ensuring user security through a robust authentication system.

## Key Features:

1. **Full-Stack Design and Development**:
   - Full-stack application for managing online surveys.
   - **Frontend**: User-friendly and responsive interface built with Angular.
   - **Backend**: RESTful API developed with Spring Boot to manage surveys and users.

2. **Secure Authentication**:
   - Implemented a secure authentication system with **Spring Security** and **JWT** to protect user and administrator data.

3. **Real-Time Statistics**:
   - Developed a **real-time statistics module** that allows administrators to view survey results dynamically, as they are submitted.

4. **Dynamic Form Management**:
   - Integrated dynamic management of **questions** and **options** for surveys, enabling administrators to easily create, modify, and update surveys as needed.

## How the System Works:

- **Survey Creation**: Administrators can create surveys by adding questions and options, then publish them for users to respond.
- **User Responses**: Users can answer surveys by selecting from the available options.
- **Results Analysis**: Administrators can view real-time results, analyze responses, and get detailed statistics.

## Technologies and Tools Used:
- **Frontend**: Angular, HTML, CSS, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT
- **Database**: MySQL

## Summary:

QuickSurvey simplifies the management of online surveys with an intuitive user interface and powerful tools for dynamic survey management. The system also ensures optimal security through JWT authentication, while allowing administrators to track survey results in real-time.
